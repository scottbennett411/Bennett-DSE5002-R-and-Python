Please complete all exercises below WITHOUT using any libraries/packages.

# Exercise 1
Assign 10 to the variable x. Assign 5 to the variable y. Assign 20 to the variable z.

```{r ex1}
x <- 10
y <- 5
z <- 20
```


# Exercise 2
Show that x is less than z but greater than y.

**Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean, do not output a boolean for each expression.**

```{r ex2}
x < z && x > y
```

# Exercise 3
Show that x and y do not equal z. 

**Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean, do not output a boolean for each expression.**

```{r ex3}
x != z && y != z
```


# Exercise 4
Show that the formula `x + 2y = z`. 

**Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean**

```{r ex4}
x+2*y == z
```

# Exercise 5
I have created a vector (test_vector) of integers for you. Determine if any of x, y, or z are in the vector. 

**Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean, do not output a boolean for each expression.**


```{r ex5}
test_vector <- c(1,5,11:22)

 z || y || x %in% test_vector
```

# Exercise 6
Show which value is contained in the test vector. To do this you will need to create an element-wise logical vector using operators. `x == vector`. Once you have done that you will need to use slicing to return all indices that have matches.
**Note: your output should be two integers**

```{r ex6}
c(test_vector[x == test_vector], test_vector[y == test_vector], test_vector[z == test_vector])
```
