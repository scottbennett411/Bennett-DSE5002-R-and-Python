    "\n",
    "There are plenty of advantages to learning Python and using it due to it being a general purpose programming language. Since it wasn't created for a specific purpose, it is really versatile and can support projects from the analytic side of Data Science to integrating that data into applications. It is also considered one of the easiest languages to learn and therefore has become the most common programming language in the world, these means that the barrier to entry for coders is much lower. As general purpose language it also has a very large community across multiple industries that help people collaborate either just by asking questions on online forums to ensuring that libraries are current.\n",

    "One of the main criticisms of Python is how slow it is, so for applications where differences of speed are important, it might not be the best option. [Advantages and Disadvantages of Python](https://understandingdata.com/posts/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-python/) It also doesn't have as extensive libraries for data exploration and experimentation. Additionally, it is not as good at displaying visuals as other options such as R. Sometimes by being a jack of all trades, it isn't the best option for hyper specialized work that might be better suited for another language. [IBM: Python vs. R](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/python-vs-r) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is it Popular\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas R is a really helpful tool for statistics and for data analysis, I think that Python is more popular with data scientists and machine learning engineers for a variety of reasons. Data scientists do more than just analyze data, they also come up with ways to model data and make predictions about the future. As such, using a language like Python is helpful because it is more flexible and better for designing new tools to help with data science than R is. It is also better for machine learning with its specialized deep learning and machine learning libraries that help data scientists develop data models. Finally, Python is better at collecting data from the web where R needs more structured data formats. [IBM: Python vs. R](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/python-vs-r) \n",
